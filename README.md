# SentIta-Lite
SentIta Lite is a Sentiment lexicon for the Italian language made by Serena Pelosi, Research Fellow at ICAR CNR (Italy) and former contract professor in Linguistics and new media at the University of Salerno.

This lite version of the entire lexicon named SentIta interacts with Doxa, a prototype that, interacting with the lexical database, applies a set of linguistic rules for the Documentlevel Opinionated teXt Analysis.

This Lexicon has been presented in the 2015 and updated in several other works, following listed:
