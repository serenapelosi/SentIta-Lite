# SentIta (Lite version)
SentIta Lite is a Sentiment lexicon for the Italian language made by Serena Pelosi, Research Fellow at ICAR CNR (Italy) and former Contract Professor in "Linguistics and New Media" at the University of Salerno.

This lite version (about 1000 words) of the entire lexicon named SentIta interacts with Doxa, a prototype that, interacting with the lexical database, applies a set of linguistic rules for the Documentlevel Opinionated teXt Analysis.

File structure:

Sentita attributes to each Italian lemma information that concern the part of speech of reference, (PoS); the Polarity (Positive or Negative); the intensity (Intense or Weak) and, in the end, a sentiment score that takes into account both the polarity and the intensity measures and ranges from -3 (for strongly negative lemmas) to +3 (for strongly positive ones).
